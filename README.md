Airline companies received large volumes of customer feedback on social media, making it essential to analyze these opinions to understand customer satisfaction and improve services.\ This study focused on sentiment analysis of airline-related tweets using the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data}{\textbf{US Airline Sentiment}} dataset.\ The primary objective was to classify tweets into sentiment categories and compare the performance of three machine learning models: \texttt{Decision Tree}, \texttt{RNN}, \texttt{CNN} and \texttt{Transformers}.\ The dataset contained 14,640 tweets collected over a ten-day period in February 2015 from six major United States airlines, each labeled with sentiment and additional contextual features.

\noindent Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance through oversampling.\ Exploratory analysis showed that \textbf{United Airlines} and \textbf{US Airways} accounted for the largest share of negative tweets.\ \textbf{Customer service} was identified as the primary driver of dissatisfaction, indicating that interpersonal interactions had a greater impact on sentiment than operational issues such as delays or cancellations.
